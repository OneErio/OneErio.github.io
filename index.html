                An Australian study showed that cell phone use while driving was associated with slightly more than a fourfold increase in crash risk (odds ratio 4:1).

                The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that at any given time, 6 percent of drivers nationwide were holding a cell phone to their ear.

                A review of 84 studies of the impact of cell phone use on driving performance concluded that whereas cell phone use has only a small or moderate impact on driving performance measures such as driving speed, lane position, and various other measures of vehicle control, it significantly slows the driver’s speed of reaction to critical events 0.23 seconds.

                Talking on the phone while driving differs depending on the age of the driver.

Of the Matures (64+), 42 percent.

                The states of California and so on, outlaw the use of handheld phones while driving. Alaska, and so on , prohibit all drivers from text messaging while driving.
